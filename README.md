# ConsoleSkeletons.js
It is finally here! A modern web javascript solution to flood your console with skeletons.

"But, why?" You may ask...
Simple!
The browser console is a boring place full of errors on a bad day, or nothing on better ones.
This needs to change.

Console Skeleton gives it a strong skeleton presence, that will indefinitely keep your console an entertaining place.

For a live demo visit:

(make sure to open your browsers console otherwise you defeat the purpose of Console Skeletons)

For detailed instal instructions see:

Features:

* Skeleton can dance forever. There is no end. This may engage visitors for longer as they stay fixated on your console.

* In the event you are suspicious of skeletons you can choose other characters such as:
	- "lolskull"
	- "barrelroll"
	- "YMCA"
	- "orly"
	- "moocow"
	- "Timothy"
  - "skeletor" is selected by default.

* Skeletons are safe for work! Even if skeletons don't wear clothes, and are essentially naked, there is nothing to see. Your boss will not fire you for using ConsoleSkeletons.js

* Skeletons probably do not work in Safari. This is OK, and perfectly natural. Skeletons may be rendered as an indiscernible pile of bones in certain skeleton adverse browsers.
